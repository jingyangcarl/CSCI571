They will, however, follow up inquiries into those who Cleary said had come to his home and stayed for 10 minutes. </p> \n<p>Fellow rule-breakers <strong>Josh Addo-Carr </strong>and<strong> Latrell Mitchell</strong>, for comparison, were fined $1,000 after they were photographed in a group of men at a farm. But it appears that Cleary escaped a similar fine as the visit was unplanned and he did not leave his house.</p> \n<p>“Following inquiries conducted by Nepean Police Area Command, no offence relating to the 22-year-old man was detected,” a police spokeswoman said. “Investigations are continuing into other potential offences.”<br></p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the <strong>AFL</strong> is aware of a video in which three Fremantle players are seen in a group of people, reportedly on Sunday night. The gathering of seven people, which included star defender <strong>Luke Ryan</strong> and fringe players <strong>Michael Frederick</strong> and <strong>Jason Carter</strong>, has prompted a club investigation. </p> \n<p>Before Monday, gatherings in Western Australia were limited to two people. That limit is now 10. </p> \n<p>“We have been made aware of a video of a small gathering of people at a home on Sunday night, including three Fremantle players,” a Dockers spokesman told AAP.<br></p> \n<p>“We are in the process of speaking to the players involved and gathering all the relevant details and information. Once that is completed, the club will be in a position to comment further.”</p>"

That is strictly prohibited by a biosecurity direction of <strong>Greg Hunt</strong> by agreement with the states and by legislation. <br></p> <p>So it’s very safe, it’s very secure, it serves a very important purpose and everyone in WA wants to get their lives back and get their businesses back on track and get our economy roaring back to life.

Australians will find markets, as we have been now for a long time, all around the world, and for many years now our markets have been diversified. <br></p> \n <p>I mean, the predominance of our trading relationship with China is obviously resources-based, and I see no reason why that would alter in the future. <br></p> \n <p>I mean, the thing about our relationship with China is it is a mutually beneficial one. <br></p> \n <p>It is a comprehensive strategic partnership, and we will continue to pursue that partnership, respecting China’s sovereignty, and their independence, and its success will continue to depend on that being returned.</p> \n</blockquote>"

While not mandatory for independent schools, this advice is that schools should provide remote and flexible learning for the majority of their students, while providing onsite learning for those who have no alternative. Just two weeks ago the federal government told us that independent schools that acted in accord with Victorian government health advice were effectively compliant with federal advice.

                            "bodyTextSummary": "Sales at the supermarket giant Coles soared more than 13% due to panic buying sparked by the coronavirus crisis. In a statement to the stock exchange Coles said its supermarkets had sold more than $8.2bn of stuff in the first three months of 2020, compared with about $7.2bn at the same time last year. It said its costs were also going to be higher because it had hired extra people to restock shelves and run its stores during longer trading hours. The crisis also caused price hikes averaging 2.6% for supermarket goods because some things were in short supply and Coles stopped putting goods on special due to the floods of shoppers in their stores. By contrast, prices went up by average 0.9% at the same time last year, and if fresh food and cigarettes are excluded actually went down 1.4%. Coles also thinks the virus crisis has changed what people are buying. “As more customers either work at home or stay at home there is early evidence of customers changing their habits, purchasing less convenience and impulse products and moving towards more cooking and baking from scratch,” it said. “This is supported by the best viewer numbers of MasterChef in five years.”",

Demanding the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, make urgent changes to protect workers, firms and the wider economy, the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) said the Treasury’s multibillion-pound coronavirus job retention scheme needed to be made more flexible to allow furloughed staff to work reduced hours. It also said the scheme should run until at least the end of September to help firms through continuing lockdown measures or the gradual easing of tough controls on social and business activity across Britain.",

                            "bodyTextSummary": "China bristles at call by Australia to investigate Covid-19 origin The Guardian’s Paul Karp and Helen Davidson report: The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has defied China and defended the “entirely reasonable and sensible” call for an investigation into the origins of Covid-19, as the international political fallout over the pandemic deepened. China has been pushing back against criticism from other governments about how it handled the outbreak of coronavirus, which is believed to have started in Wuhan and which has now infected 3 million people worldwide and killed 200,000. Donald Trump’s accusation at the weekend that Beijing could have done more to prevent the deadly spread of the disease was met with fierce criticism from China’s state media. While Australia has eschewed the more strident approach of the US, which has stopped funding to the World Health Organisation (WHO), it has urged its allies to back an overhaul of the WHO and suggested recruiting independent investigators akin to “weapons inspectors” to determine the source of major disease outbreaks. On Wednesday Morrison said his government “will of course continue to pursue what is a very reasonable and sensible course of action”.",

Despite calls from the UN for a global ceasefire during the coronavirus crisis, the military, known as the Tatmadaw, has instead escalated its fight against the Arakan Army (AA), an ethnic Rakhine rebel group seeking greater autonomy from central government.<br><br>The military has not only injured and killed scores of civilians, including children, in recent air and artillery strikes, Lee said, but also blocked some of the injured from accessing urgent medical care. In one case, a teenage boy died at a military checkpoint in Rakhine after the military forced the vehicle transporting him to wait there on the way to hospital. It is not clear how the boy was injured.</p> \n<p>In attacks that are reminiscent of the 2017 military assault on Rohingya people, schools, houses, a Buddhist temple, and in one case a village of up to 700 homes had been destroyed or burned to the ground. The military has also disappeared, arrested, tortured or killed dozens of men, often accusing them of links to the Arakan Army. Entire villages have fled the violence.</p> \n<p>“Having faced no accountability, the Tatmadaw continues to operate with impunity. For decades, its tactics have intentionally maximised civilian suffering; we all know what they did to the Rohingya in 2017. They are now targeting all civilians in the conflict area, with people from Rakhine, Rohingya, Mro, Daignet and Chin communities being killed in recent months,” said Lee, who is concluding her tenure as special rapporteur.</p> \n<p>Lee cited a recent artillery attack, on 13 April, in which eight civilians died, including at least two children, when the military targeted Kyauk Seik village in Ponnagyun township.</p> \n<p>“The Tatmadaw is systematically violating the most fundamental principles of international humanitarian law and human rights. Its conduct against the civilian population of Rakhine and Chin states may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity,” she added.</p>"

Humanitarian agencies fear communities in conflict areas are especially vulnerable to the virus, which could spread quickly in camps where displaced people are living in close quarters with extremely limited access to healthcare. <br><br>Earlier this month, a driver working for the World Health Organization who was transporting swabs from patients to be tested for coronavirus was killed after his vehicle was attacked by gunfire in Rakhine state. Both Myanmar’s army and the Arakan Army denied responsibility for the attack.</p> \n<p>More than 157,000 people have been displaced since the conflict began, according to the UN. Vast numbers of people have been cut off from aid by the military, including 8,000 displaced people sheltering in Paletwa township in Chin.</p> \n<p>Internet access is also blocked in many conflict-affected areas, meaning people have little access to information about how to protect themselves against the coronavirus, and making it harder for communities to document atrocities committed by armed actors. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/myanmar-editor-could-face-life-in-jail-for-interviewing-rebel\">crackdown on journalists</a> has also been ramped up, forcing editors to live in hiding and further restricting information about human rights abuses.</p> \n<p>Civilians have also been affected by violence carried out by the Arakan Army, which has kidnapped local officials and parliamentarians. Just weeks ago, the group is reported to have abducted an elected member of a Paletwa township committee. However the Arakan Army has declared a unilateral ceasefire, which has improved protections for civilians.</p> \n<p>Lee called for an investigation into allegations of ongoing war crimes and crimes against humanity in both Rakhine and Chin states, to ensure perpetrators are held to account. Lee also urged the UN to increase protections for civilians.</p>"

                            "bodyTextSummary": "The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has defied China and defended the “entirely reasonable and sensible” call for an investigation into the origins of coronavirus, as the international political fallout over the pandemic deepened. China has been pushing back against criticism from other governments about how it handled the outbreak of Covid-19, which is believed to have started in Wuhan and which has now infected 3 million people worldwide and killed 200,000. Donald Trump’s accusation at the weekend that Beijing could have done more to prevent the deadly spread of the disease was met with fierce criticism from China’s state media. While Australia has eschewed the more strident approach of the US, which has stopped funding to the World Health Organisation (WHO), it has urged its allies to back an overhaul of the WHO and suggested recruiting independent investigators akin to “weapons inspectors” to determine the source of major disease outbreaks. On Wednesday Morrison said his government “will of course continue to pursue what is a very reasonable and sensible course of action”.\n“This is a virus that has taken more than 200,000 lives across the world,” he told reporters in Canberra. It has shut down the global economy. The implications and impacts of this are extraordinary. “Now, it would seem entirely reasonable and sensible that the world would want to have an independent assessment of how this all occurred, so we can learn the lessons and prevent it from happening again.” Australia’s stance has angered Beijing, which has denied wrongdoing during the pandemic . In recent days Chinese state media has run numerous inflammatory statements including that Australia was “gum stuck to the bottom of China’s shoe”, doing the work of the US but without holding any influence, and risking longterm damage to its bilateral relationship and trading partnership with China. On Tuesday, the Chinese embassy released details of a call from Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Dfat), and in a further move to embarrass the Morrison government, claimed the Dfat secretary had said it was “not the time to commence the review now and Australia has no details of the proposal”. The move came after warnings by China’s ambassador to Australia, Jingye Cheng, on Monday over consumer boycotts, described by an Australian minister as “threats of economic coercion”. A Tuesday night editorial in the Global Times accused Australia of “panda bashing” and victim blaming, and Morrison of “adventurism” which could damage the bilateral relationship “beyond repair”. “The Morrison government’s adventurism to fiddle with this mutually beneficial comprehensive strategic partnership is in defiance of rational thought and common sense,” it said. “Canberra is treading on a hazardous path that has no prospect for a U-turn during the Covid-19 pandemic, and likely for a long time afterward.”\nBut on Wednesday Morrison insisted the investigation “is not targeted” and refused to buy in to the war of words with China, saying the response was “a matter for them”. “Australia will do what is in our interest, in the global interest, and we will of course continue to support moves to ensure there is a proper independent assessment of what has occurred here.” Morrison said Australia’s relationship with China was “mutually beneficial” and noted its trade with China consisted mainly of export of resources. “I see no reason why that would alter in the future.” In other coronavirus developments around the world: The number of US cases passed one million as Donald Trump predicted a “great” economic rebound in the fall and claimed the country would soon be performing 5m coronavirus diagnostic tests a day. Brazil’s total number of confirmed deaths overtook the WHO’s figure for China as cases accelerate in Latin America’s biggest country. The number of deaths in Brazil has now passed 5,000. China announced the resumption of its parliament on 22 May after a two month delay. Nearly 70 residents infected with coronavirus died at a Massachusetts home for ageing veterans, as state and federal officials try to figure out what went wrong in the deadliest known outbreak at a long-term care facility in the US. China reported zero new deaths as of the end of 28 April. There were 26 new asymptomatic cases, down from 40 the day before, but 21 new imported cases, compared to three a day earlier, and 22 cases in the mainland. The Academy Awards will for the first time allow films that debuted on a streaming service without a theatrical run to be eligible for nominations, a break with tradition in direct response to the coronavirus pandemic.",

Let’s set the controls for the heart of the news …</p> <p>The UK government’s plan to subsidise workers’ wages should be extended until at least autumn, the trade body for the human resources sector has argued. Peter Cheese from the CIPD said extending the scheme until at least September would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/29/extend-coronavirus-wage-subsidies-or-risk-delayed-redundancies-firms-warn\">prevent the job retention scheme becoming a “waiting room” for eventual redundancy</a>. The CIPD is calling on the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, for urgent changes including allowing furloughed staff to work reduced hours. There are early signs the furlough scheme is working, with more than 4m positions protected following the first week of its operation. Extending it could add £12bn a month to the cost to the exchequer, according to the Resolution Foundation.</p> <p>British Airways has set out plans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/british-airways-plans-to-make-up-to-12000-staff-redundant\">make up to 12,000 of its staff redundant</a> because of the global collapse in air travel. Its chief executive, Alex Cruz, has told the airline’s 42,000 staff that it “must act decisively now to ensure that British Airways has a strong future”. The UK’s flag carrier has placed 22,600 people on the government’s furlough scheme and the CEO wrote to staff that it “cannot expect the taxpayer to offset salaries indefinitely … Yesterday, British Airways flew just a handful of aircraft out of Heathrow. On a normal day we would fly more than 300.” Unions have reacted with shock and anger to the announcement.</p> <p>The number of US cases has passed one million as Donald Trump predicted an economic rebound in the fall and claimed there would soon be 5m coronavirus diagnostic tests a day. An international row has erupted as the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, backed calls for an investigation of the origins and spread of the novel coronavirus. The Chinese government has responded by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/australia-defends-plan-to-investigate-china-over-covid-19-outbreak-as-row-deepens\">blasting out belittling messages about “panda bashing” and “victim blaming”</a> by Australia.

                            "bodyTextSummary": "Top story: Call to extend job retention scheme Hello, Warren Murray with you once again this morning. Let’s set the controls for the heart of the news … The UK government’s plan to subsidise workers’ wages should be extended until at least autumn, the trade body for the human resources sector has argued. Peter Cheese from the CIPD said extending the scheme until at least September would prevent the job retention scheme becoming a “waiting room” for eventual redundancy. The CIPD is calling on the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, for urgent changes including allowing furloughed staff to work reduced hours. There are early signs the furlough scheme is working, with more than 4m positions protected following the first week of its operation. Extending it could add £12bn a month to the cost to the exchequer, according to the Resolution Foundation. British Airways has set out plans to make up to 12,000 of its staff redundant because of the global collapse in air travel. Its chief executive, Alex Cruz, has told the airline’s 42,000 staff that it “must act decisively now to ensure that British Airways has a strong future”. The UK’s flag carrier has placed 22,600 people on the government’s furlough scheme and the CEO wrote to staff that it “cannot expect the taxpayer to offset salaries indefinitely … Yesterday, British Airways flew just a handful of aircraft out of Heathrow. On a normal day we would fly more than 300.” Unions have reacted with shock and anger to the announcement. The number of US cases has passed one million as Donald Trump predicted an economic rebound in the fall and claimed there would soon be 5m coronavirus diagnostic tests a day. An international row has erupted as the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, backed calls for an investigation of the origins and spread of the novel coronavirus. The Chinese government has responded by blasting out belittling messages about “panda bashing” and “victim blaming” by Australia. Keep following the latest coronavirus news at our live blog. There’s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down … and here’s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak – from breaking news to factchecks and advice. * * * Close encounter – An asteroid more than a mile wide is set to make a pass by Earth, although scientists insist it poses no danger. Known as (52768) 1998 OR2, the asteroid will come to about 3.9 million miles away on Wednesday, 16 times further than the distance to the Moon, when it makes its closest approach. The Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico has been tracking the 1.2 mile-wide object after Nasa first spotted it in 1998. * * * Midweek catch-up > A gang of up to five males believed to be wearing medical-style masks and gloves stabbed an NHS worker to death days before his father’s funeral. David Gomoh, 24, was set upon after leaving his home close to the NHS Nightingale field hospital. Police say it was an unprovoked killing of a wholly innocent victim. > WhatsApp is alleging in court that the Israeli spyware company NSO Group was “deeply involved” in hacking 1,400 of its users including senior government officials, journalists and human rights activists. > Priti Patel is expected to be cleared this week of bullying senior civil servants in three government departments, Whitehall sources have said. The home secretary is still being taken to an administrative tribunal for constructive dismissal by her ex-permanent secretary at the Home Office, Sir Philip Rutnam. > MPs are to try to outlaw the courtroom murder defence of “rough sex gone wrong” during parliamentary debates on the domestic abuse bill, which has come back before the House of Commons. * * * Fear leader – Kim Jong-un is not ill and might just be sheltering from the coronavirus pandemic, according to South Korean and US officials, in the latest possible explanation for his absence from public life. North Korea insists it has yet to identify a single case of Covid-19, despite bordering China where the outbreak is believed to have started. Recent reports claimed Kim had undergone heart surgery but the South Korean unification minister, Kim Yeon-chul, has now said the Marshall may simply be taking precautions against Covid-19. Some US officials have said they believe Kim is sheltering from the virus in the east coast resort town of Wonsan. Coronavirus Extra Hannah Devlin speaks to Professor Sabra Klein for our science podcast, asking why women are much less likely to become seriously ill or die from Covid-19 and what the implications might be for future treatments.\nIs a “greater depression” running through the 2020s inevitable? Ominous and risky trends were around long before Covid-19, making an L-shaped depression very likely, Nouriel Roubini argues. Today in Focus podcast: Why is the NHS short of kit? As medics and carers report widespread shortages of protective equipment, the government is facing pressure to explain why it appears the UK went into a pandemic under-resourced. Daniel Boffey and Rob Davies unpick the strategy and its failures.\nLunchtime read: Alan Cumming – me and my foreskin The Hollywood star and bestselling author is becoming a podcaster. Talking to Chris Godfrey, he discusses his fight against circumcision, his fear of Harvey Weinstein – and why he is an optimist to the core.\nSport Premier League clubs are concerned about supporters gathering outside stadiums if the season resumes and fear football will be blamed if breaches of physical distancing guidelines result in a rise in coronavirus cases. The fiancee of Jamal Khashoggi has called on the Premier League to stop the acquisition of Newcastle United by Saudi Arabia, saying that completion of the deal would tarnish English football and make it complicit in the “cover-up” of the journalist’s murder by the kingdom. David Warner has poured cold water on the prospect of Australia touring the UK this summer, giving the England and Wales Cricket Board a fresh headache as it prepares to postpone the Hundred by 12 months. Coach Steve McNamara has said Catalans Dragons could relocate to England to fulfil their obligations in Super League after all sport in France was banned until September. Uefa could press ahead with plans to stage the final stages of the Champions League behind closed doors and at neutral venues after the French government confirmed there would be no professional football allowed in the country until at least 1 September. And the World Surf League has announced world titles will be decided by a new grand final surf-off starting next year. Business Google’s parent company, Alphabet, has reported its weakest first quarter revenues for five years in an indicator of how the world’s biggest companies will be affected by coronavirus. Asian stock markets gained overnight after France and Spain joined governments that plan to ease anti-virus controls and allow businesses to reopen. Benchmarks in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Sydney and south-east Asia advanced but Japanese markets were closed for a holiday.

Cancer experts claim that an extra 6,270 people in England who have been newly diagnosed with the disease could die from it over the next 12 months as a direct result of the disruption caused by coronavirus, and the additional toll taking into account all those living with cancer could be 17,915.</p> <h2><strong>Fitch downgrades Italy’s rating to BBB-</strong></h2> <p>Italy is the European country most affected by Covid-19 and trails only the United States in the number of deaths.The government has said it expects the country’s economic output to shrink by 8% this year and has launched a host of stimulus measures.</p> <h2><strong>USS Theodore Roosevelt navy sailors will begin moving back on board</strong></h2> <p>Navy sailors who have been quarantined on Guam for weeks will begin moving back to the USS Theodore Roosevelt on Tuesday night, US officials said. A coronavirus outbreak sidelined the aircraft carrier in late March. The ship gained attention when it was forced to dock in Guam because of the virus outbreak and its commander was fired for sending an email pleading with Navy bosses to take faster action to address the virus.</p> <h2><strong>Streamed films to be eligible for Oscars</strong></h2> <p>Films released on streaming platforms only will be eligible for Academy Awards next year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/28/academy-awards-oscars-streaming-films-coronavirus\">because of the pandemic’s disruption to the industry</a>, the organisers of the Oscars have said.

Virus crisis could lead to 18,000 more cancer deaths in UK, experts warn Almost 18,000 more people with cancer in England could die after the coronavirus pandemic led hospitals to suspend treatment and deterred patients from seeking NHS care, research has found. Cancer experts claim that an extra 6,270 people in England who have been newly diagnosed with the disease could die from it over the next 12 months as a direct result of the disruption caused by coronavirus, and the additional toll taking into account all those living with cancer could be 17,915.

The numbers are likely to be significant underestimates due to suspected underreporting and differing testing and recording systems around the world. US cases account for roughly a third of the known global total, at over 1 million.</p> \n<h2><strong>China’s parliament will start its annual meeting on 22 May</strong></h2> \n<p>China’s parliament is set to hold its annual meeting on 22 May, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Wednesday, more than two months later than originally planned. China’s top political consultative body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, has also proposed to start its annual session on 21 May. It’s not clear yet how long the meetings will last. They traditionally see more than 5,000 delegates descend on Beijing from all over China for at least 10 days.</p> \n<h2><strong>China warns relationship with Australia could be damaged ‘beyond repair’ </strong></h2> \n<p>The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has defied China and defended the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/australia-defends-plan-to-investigate-china-over-covid-19-outbreak-as-row-deepens\">“entirely reasonable and sensible”</a> call for an investigation into the origins of Covid-19, as the international political fallout over the pandemic deepened.

Italian and British medical experts are investigating a possible link between the coronavirus pandemic and clusters of Kawasaki disease, a severe inflammatory disease among infants arriving in hospitals with high fevers and swollen arteries.</p> \n<h2><strong>Nearly 70 residents have died at a Massachusetts home for ageing veterans</strong></h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/coronavirus-massachusetts-veterans-outbreak-holyoke-soldiers-home\">Sixty-eight veteran residents</a> at the state-run Holyoke Soldiers’ Home who tested positive for the virus have died, officials said Tuesday, and it’s not known whether another person who died had Covid-19.

                            "bodyTextSummary": "WhatsApp has alleged in new court filings that an Israeli spyware company used US-based servers and was “deeply involved” in carrying out mobile phone hacks of 1,400 WhatsApp users, including senior government officials, journalists, and human rights activists. The new claims about NSO Group allege that the Israeli company bears responsibility in serious human rights violations, including the hacking of more than a dozen Indian journalists and Rwandan dissidents. For years, NSO Group has said that its spyware is purchased by government clients for the purpose of tracking down terrorists and other criminals and that it had no independent knowledge of how those clients – which in the past have reportedly included Saudi Arabia and Mexico – use its hacking software. But a lawsuit filed by WhatsApp against NSO Group last year – the first of its kind by a major technology company - is revealing more technical details about how the hacking software, Pegasus, is allegedly deployed against targets. In the court filings last week, WhatsApp said its own investigation into how Pegasus was used against 1,400 users last year showed that servers controlled by NSO Group – not its government clients – were an integral part of how the hacks were executed. WhatsApp has said victims of the hack received phone calls using its messaging app, and were infected with Pegasus. Then, it said: “NSO used a network of computers to monitor and update Pegasus after it was implanted on users’ devices. These NSO-controlled computers served as the nerve centre through which NSO controlled its customers’ operation and use of Pegasus.” According to WhatsApp’s filing, NSO gained “unauthorised access” to its servers by reverse-engineering the messaging app and then evading the company’s security features that prevent manipulation of the company’s call features. One WhatsApp engineer who investigated the hacks said in a sworn statement submitted to the court that in 720 instances, the IP address of a remote server was included in the malicious code used in the attacks. The remote server, the engineer said, was based in Los Angeles and owned by a company whose data centre was used by NSO. NSO has said in legal filings that it has no insight into how government clients use its hacking tools, and therefore does not know who governments are targeting. But one expert, John Scott-Railton of Citizen Lab, who has worked with WhatsApp on the case, said NSO’s control of the servers involved in the hack suggests the company would have had logs, including IP addresses, identifying the users who were being targeted. “Whether or not NSO looks at those logs, who knows? But the fact that it could be done is contrary to what they say,” Scott-Railton said. In a statement to the Guardian, NSO stood by its earlier remarks. “Our products are used to stop terrorism, curb violent crime, and save lives. NSO Group does not operate the Pegasus software for its clients,” the company said. “Our past statements about our business, and the extent of our interaction with our government intelligence and law enforcement agency customers, are accurate.” The company said it would file its response to the court in coming days.

The drastic measure would have rendered New Zealanders overseas “stateless”, said the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, and was rejected by cabinet wholesale as an “extraordinary measure no government in the world would allow”. “It would have been extraordinary for the government to make a decision to strand New Zealanders overseas … we couldn’t entertain that. It is an extraordinary thing to deem someone stateless, we have international obligations to consider.”\nThe revelation comes as the number or coronavirus cases continues to fall with just two registered on Wednesday and six people being treated in hospital. There have been no additional deaths. Ardern said the lower numbers did not mean “New Zealand was out of the woods” but the country’s progress was positive, and compliance with level 3 measures had generally been good, with just over 100 violations on day one, 21 of which eventuated in prosecutions and 70 in warnings. On Wednesday schools around the country reopened but following government advice to keep children home if possible only 1% of students returned to classrooms, Ardern said, and 4% of children went back to early childhood centres. Nationwide there were 750 complaints of businesses not following level 3 guidelines, with most complaints relating to a failure to institute social distancing between customers. Earlier on Wednesday the foreign minister, Winston Peters, said 80,000 New Zealanders had returned home since 14 March. “The ministry of health recommended a total shutdown of the border, including to returning New Zealanders. From its health perspective, this was understandable and appropriate advice,” he said. “But the Coalition cabinet rejected that advice because it was and is inconceivable that we will ever turn our backs on our own.” As New Zealand moved from level 4 lockdown to level 3, a photo of people clustered outside a burger bar on the first evening takeaway food shops were allowed to reopen has caused a scandal that drew a response from the prime minister. “I’m worried for us,” one Twitter user said of the cluster of about 30 people outside an Auckland outlet of the fast food chain Burger Fuel (the name of the store was one of the top trending topics on Twitter in New Zealand).\n“This shit was insane!!” said Dan Arakawa, who took the photo, on Facebook.

Police said they had visited the store to provide “education” about physical distancing. Burger Fuel would begin to deploy “crowd controllers” outside its stores, according to the New Zealand Herald.</p> \n<p>Ardern said: “We have had confirmation from officials this morning they have been directly in contact with the head office of that operation.”</p> \n<p>The gathering was perhaps a sign of New Zealanders’ joy at being reunited with takeaway food. Stores, restaurants, cafes, and meal delivery services had all been closed under the strictest lockdown measures, which were eased in New Zealand on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>The measures have been only slightly relaxed, however, meaning takeaway meals were one of few new activities people could enjoy – leading to a flood of pictures of burgers, fries, and fillets of battered fish on social media, delivery apps overloaded or crashing, and police managing traffic outside some stores.</p> \n<p>Clarke Gayford, the PM’s partner, summed up the frenzy in a video he posted on Twitter with the caption “NZ anticipating takeaways starting again like …” that showed a jaguar dragging an alligator out of a river.</p>"

During the past month of New Zealand’s strict, so-called “level 4” lockdown, people could only leave the house for groceries, medical help or local exercise. Takeaway food or meal deliveries were barred, and all shops except supermarkets and pharmacies closed.</p> \n<p>In most Australian states, meeting a friend for a coffee was permitted, and partners or babysitters could make home visits – both verboten in New Zealand. Australian retail and construction largely remained open.</p> \n<p>While New Zealand dropped to marginally looser “level 3” restrictions on Monday, the Australian allowances for haircuts and meeting friends remain off-limits. Takeaway food is back on the menu, and retailers can open for online and contactless transactions, but most people are still required to remain home most of the time.</p> \n<p>Some commentators said the New Zealand restrictions would take a starker toll on the economy and mental health.</p>"

But it was too early to know which country would fare better, and there were factors other than the strictness of lockdown measures at play.</p> \n<p>“It really depends on the health outcome,” Eaqub said. “If there are future waves of infections, then any further shutdown is going to have a really damaging effect. Businesses might be able to survive one shutdown but I don’t think they could survive two.”</p> \n<p>Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s prime minister, agreed, telling voters she did not want to see them “lose any of the gains we have made” by coming out of restrictive lockdown measures too early.</p> \n<p>Ardern did not face the same situation Australia’s leader Scott Morrison did when deciding what level of lockdown was appropriate, said Brian Cox, an epidemiologist from the University of Otago in Dunedin. New Zealand’s “clusters” of the virus were larger, relative to population size, and tracing contacts of those infected was, initially, taking several days longer for New Zealand’s officials than those in Australia.</p> \n<p>“You can’t compare today in Australia with today in New Zealand,” he said. “The epidemic in Australia has essentially been going for another two weeks and our epidemic was taking off a lot faster than Australia’s. We had to do a serious correction to get anywhere near where we’ve got to now.”</p>    \n<p>Analysts say both countries, in their attempt to stave off another wave of the illness, could face the same foe.</p> \n<p>“Winter is coming,” said ANU microbiologist Peter Collignon, referring to the faster spread of the virus during the northern hemisphere’s colder weather and flu season.</p> \n<p>“We will potentially be keeping quite significant restrictions on when we see the US and Europe relaxing them because it’s summer. That’s going to be an issue about convincing people to in fact keep on what we’re doing now until at least September,” he added.</p> \n<p>“That’s why I don’t think a complete lockdown is an option.”</p>"
