But the role of face masks for the general public remains contentious.</p> <p>This week, Boris Johnson said face coverings will be “useful” going forwards, suggesting they may give people confidence when going back to work, while Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/28/sturgeon-urges-scots-to-wear-coronavirus-face-masks-for-shopping-and-travel\">said the Scottish public should wear them</a> in cases where it is difficult to maintain physical distancing, for example when shopping, although the guidance is not mandatory.

It is understood the UK’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/ministers-split-over-coronavirus-advice-on-wearing-face-masks\">has similarly advised</a> the government there is weak evidence face masks can reduce the spread of infection.</p> <p>However, some scientists have said the public should wear masks as a part of the ‘precautionary principle’, adding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/21/scientists-join-calls-for-uk-public-to-wear-homemade-face-masks-outdoors\">these can be homemade</a>, noting surgical masks should only be used by health and social care workers.

There is cautious optimism around an experimental coronavirus drug There are signs the antiviral medicine remdesivir – which has previously been used in Ebola patients – may be a useful tool in helping those with Covid-19. While it is not a “cure”, a new trial has suggested it can reduce the recovery time of those seriously ill with the disease. Early results from an international trial of 1,000 participants reveal the drug cut recovery time from a median of 15 days to 11 and was also linked to a better chance of survival.\nThe findings come after results from a smaller trial among patients in China, that was cut short, initially suggested the drug had little effect. “What it has proven is that a drug can block this virus,” said Dr Anthony Fauci, the US government’s top infectious disease expert. However experts have warned the drug is unlikely to be available widely in the UK any time soon, as it is very difficult to obtain, while they say the trial’s data must also be rigorously analysed and licensing approved. In the last edition of Science Weekly, Sarah Boseley talks to Prof Helen McShane about why there has been interest in the tuberculosis vaccine and whether it could play a role in protecting us against Covid-19\nIn the UK, face masks continue to be a hot topic Boris Johnson has said the UK has passed the peak in the outbreak and is planning to outline the country’s exit strategy next week. But the role of face masks for the general public remains contentious. This week, Boris Johnson said face coverings will be “useful” going forwards, suggesting they may give people confidence when going back to work, while Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said the Scottish public should wear them in cases where it is difficult to maintain physical distancing, for example when shopping, although the guidance is not mandatory. However, she cautioned that people should not feel “invincible” when wearing a mask, or stop adhering to distancing guidelines. Experts have previously said that while wearing face masks in the community may reduce the chance of an infected person spreading the virus, there is no evidence they reduce the chance of being infected, and may even offer a false sense of security. It is understood the UK’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has similarly advised the government there is weak evidence face masks can reduce the spread of infection. However, some scientists have said the public should wear masks as a part of the ‘precautionary principle’, adding these can be homemade, noting surgical masks should only be used by health and social care workers. Sturgeon has recommended the public use something like a scarf or bandana.\nDoctors around the world are reporting a rare inflammatory condition in children In countries including the US, France, Spain and the UK, doctors are reporting cases of children with an unusual, but potentially deadly, inflammatory syndrome that has been linked to Covid-19. According to doctors in Europe, children of all ages appear to show symptoms including fever, digestive problems and vascular inflammation. Concerns were first raised in the UK after seeing a number of children admitted to intensive care with a combination of toxic shock and an inflammatory disorder known as Kawasaki disease. However, experts say the syndrome is rare. “Whilst this is an evolving situation, it is clear that these symptoms are reported in only handfuls of cases,” said Dr Nazima Pathan, a consultant in paediatric intensive care in Cambridge. “The important message is that if parents are worried about their children’s health, they should seek medical advice.”\nWhile progress is made with a coronavirus vaccine, doctors have raised concerns routine vaccinations are being missed Doctors say they have seen a drop in uptake of routine vaccinations as a result of the coronavirus lockdown, raising concerns that could lead to outbreaks of other diseases such as measles. In the US, MMR (mumps, measles and rubella) shots were down 50% in the week of 5 April, with diphtheria and whooping cough immunisations down 42%, while concerns have also been raised in the UK. Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners in the UK said: “Children can become very ill and die from the complications of common illnesses like measles that haven’t gone away. And immunisation is a fundamentally important part of preventing that from happening. We cannot allow delays in immunisations to go on for a long time, otherwise we really will see a crisis.”",

It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. </p> \n<p>It was – and always will be – central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014/15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p> \n<p><strong>Is it harder to do in the case of a respiratory infection?</strong></p> \n<p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street. </p> \n<p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure – originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So the contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p> \n<p><strong>What do the contact tracers do then?</strong></p> \n<p>In the way it was operating in February, the tracer would call the contacts and ask them how close they had been to the person with symptoms and establish whether they were low-risk or high-risk. If the latter, they would be asked to isolate themselves for 14 days at home. </p> \n<p>The contact tracers would either call each day to check how they were or ask them to phone if they felt ill. If they developed symptoms, the tracers would start again, looking for their contacts in turn.</p> \n<p><strong>Who does the contact tracing?</strong></p> \n<p>It is organised by Public Health England, which had 290 staff doing it before community testing stopped in mid-March. Public health in recent years has been the responsibility of local government, so any increase in contact tracers might come from councils.</p> \n<p><strong>Which other countries have done this to scale?</strong></p> \n<p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine. </p> \n<p>Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The World Health Organization says it should be the “backbone of the response” in every country.</p>"

                            "bodyTextSummary": "Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: Coronavirus threatens eurozone’s future, Brussels warns The eurozone faces an existential threat if the economic recoveries of its 19 member states are insufficiently even, the EU’s economic commissioner warns. Some countries are expected to suffer significantly more than others during what is expected to be the deepest recession since the Great Depression. “Such divergence poses a threat to the single market and the euro area – yet it can be mitigated through decisive, joint European action,” Paolo Gentiloni says. WHO warns of more lockdowns if transition not managed carefully The director general of the World Health Organization warns of the risks of returning to lockdown if countries emerging from pandemic restrictions do not manage transitions “extremely carefully and in a phased approach”. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus lists a series of steps needed before countries should lift restrictions, such as surveillance controls and health system preparedness. Germany eases restrictions but retains ‘emergency brake’ The country’s top football league, the Bundesliga, is set to resume this month – one of various restrictions to be lifted as Germans are once again allowed to meet a limited number of friends and family and some shops are allowed to reopen. The country still has a long way to go, its chancellor, Angela Merkel, says, and its 16 states will each be able to operate an “emergency break” if faced with a surge in new infections. UK could start easing virus lockdown next week The British government will set out details of its plan to ease lockdown on Sunday, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, says, adding his hope that some measures could come into force the following day. Speaking in parliament for the first time since being hospitalised with Covid-19, Johnson says “every death is a tragedy”, calling the statistics “appalling”. Ending lockdown abruptly would be ‘unforgivable’ The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, warns that abruptly ending nearly eight weeks of lockdown would be “unforgivable” as he seeks parliamentary approval to further extend the state of emergency. His efforts to renew his mandate for a lockdown that has imposed strict confinement on nearly 47 million Spaniards are being rejected by his rightwing opponents. China shrugs off US claims and calls for focus on beating pandemic China will not invite international experts in to investigate the source of Covid-19 while the pandemic is still raging, its UN ambassador says. And, continuing the diplomatic back-and-forth between Beijing and Washington, China’s foreign ministry says the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is wrong to claim he has evidence suggesting the virus originated in a Chinese lab. Sweden nears 3,000 deaths “We are starting to near 3,000 deceased, a horrifyingly large number,” Sweden’s state epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, says. The country’s public health agency reports that a total of 23,918 cases have been confirmed and 2,941 deaths recorded; an increase of 87 deaths from the day before. Rather than enforcing a lockdown, Sweden has allowed many businesses to remain open, while asking citizens to keep their distance. Iran warns of ‘rising trend’ as virus cases top 100,000 Iran records 1,680 new infections, the highest daily figure since 11 April, taking its overall caseload beyond the 100,000 mark. The country’s apparent success in controlling the epidemic has gone into reverse, with a sharp rise in the number of new daily infections over the past four days. ‘More than 90,000 health workers infected worldwide’ At least 90,000 healthcare workers globally are believed to have been infected, the International Council of Nurses (ICN) says, noting that the the true figure could be as much as twice that. It says more than 260 nurses have died amid reports of continuing shortages of protective equipment, as it urges authorities to keep more accurate records.",

States will also decide on limiting contact between people, it adds.</p> \n<h2>Pope Francis calls for workers’ dignity to be respected amid pandemic</h2> \n<p>Pope Francis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/06/coronavirus-update-cases-uk-live-news-us-task-force-trump-covid-19-usa-world-europe-deaths-brazil-brasil-israel?page=with:block-5eb283d98f08256b50834bb8#block-5eb283d98f08256b50834bb8\">has urged</a> employers to respect the dignity of workers, particularly migrants, in the face of economic difficulties brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> \n<p>Speaking at the end of his general audience, held from the papal library instead of St Peter’s Square because of Italy’s lockdown, he said: “It’s true that the crisis is affecting everyone but the dignity of people must always be respected.”</p> \n<p>The pope said he had received a series of messages about labour problems on 1 May, the day most countries celebrate workers’ rights. Francis said he wanted to defend “all exploited workers and I invite everyone to turn the crisis into an occasion where the dignity of the person and the dignity of work can be put back at the centre of things.”</p> \n<h2>Fans set to return to stadiums to watch baseball in Taiwan</h2> \n<p>Baseball fans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/06/taiwan-to-welcome-baseball-fans-back-into-stadiums-this-week\">will be let back into Taiwanese stadiums this week</a> as the government begins relaxing some controls implemented to prevent the spread of coronavirus.</p> \n<p>Taiwan has been relatively successful at controlling the virus, with 439 cases to date, six deaths, and 100 active infections, thanks to early prevention and detection efforts. The island has never gone into total lockdown, though the government has promoted social distancing and face masks.</p> \n<p>Both the baseball and football seasons got under way in Taiwan last month, but without spectators, providing rare live action for fans at home at a time when the pandemic has shut down most professional sport around the globe. The health minister, Chen Shih-chung, told reporters that 1,000 spectators would be allowed in to baseball matches on Friday in Taipei and the central city of Taichung</p> \n<h2>Europe heading for worst recession since the Great Depression, according to European commission</h2> \n<p>Europe will experience a recession this year of a depth unmatched since the Great Depression and the UK will be one of the hardest hit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/06/coronavirus-update-cases-uk-live-news-us-task-force-trump-covid-19-usa-world-europe-deaths-brazil-brasil-israel?page=with:block-5eb281d98f08256b50834ba3#block-5eb281d98f08256b50834ba3\">the European commission has said.</a></p> \n<p>Economic forecasts provided by the commission on Wednesday suggest the UK will experience an 8.3% drop in gross domestic production by the end of the year, with investment down by 14% and a doubling of unemployment.</p> \n<p>In terms of the drop in GDP – the total value of goods and services produced in a country in a year – only Italy, Greece, Spain and Croatia among the EU member states will endure a bigger loss to the economy.</p> \n<h2>Cases in Russia rise by more than 10,000 for fourth consecutive day</h2> \n<p>In Russia, the number of new Covid-19 cases surged by 10,559 over the past 24 hours, bringing the countrywide tally to 165,929, the country’s coronavirus crisis response centre has announced. It is the fourth consecutive day that cases have risen by more than 10,000. The crisis response centre also reported 86 new coronavirus deaths, meaning the death toll in Russia has reached 1,537.</p> \n<h2>UK health secretary says professor who advocated lockdown right to step down after breaking rules</h2> \n<p>The British health secretary has said he would back the police in any action they wish to take over Prof Neil Ferguson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/neil-ferguson-right-to-resign-for-breaking-lockdown-rules-says-minister-coronavirus\">breaking social distancing rules</a> by having a woman visit him at his home. Ferguson, an epidemiologist who has helped shape the government’s response to coronavirus and who advocated the lockdown, made the right decision to resign. Matt Hancock told Sky News: “I back the police here. They will take their decisions independently from ministers, that’s quite right, it’s always been like that.”</p> \n<h2>Wuhan teenagers return to school for first time since outbreak hit the Chinese City</h2> \n<p>Teenagers in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the Covid-19 pandemic began, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/06/coronavirus-update-cases-uk-live-news-us-task-force-trump-covid-19-usa-world-europe-deaths-brazil-brasil-israel?page=with:block-5eb277548f08d1ec4bbc60da#block-5eb277548f08d1ec4bbc60da\">have returned to school </a>wearing masks and walking in single file past thermal scanners. In 121 schools, older pupils were back in classrooms – sitting at individual desks spaced a metre apart – for the first time on Wednesday since the city was forced into shutdown in January. Returning pupils had to navigate thermal scanners at school gates, with anyone displaying a high temperature barred from entry.</p> \n<h2>Spain on course to extend state of emergency for another fortnight</h2> \n<p>Spain looks set to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/06/coronavirus-update-cases-uk-live-news-us-task-force-trump-covid-19-usa-world-europe-deaths-brazil-brasil-israel?page=with:block-5eb2738f8f08d1ec4bbc60b8#block-5eb2738f8f08d1ec4bbc60b8\">extend its state of emergency for two more weeks</a> as it eases Covid-19 lockdown measures, with the country’s prime minister expected to secure enough parliamentary votes today to make the move.</p> \n<p>Pedro Sanchez’s weak coalition government has the support of the regional Basque nationalist party PNV, as well as the centre-right Ciudadanos party, which said last night it would back an extension to the state of emergency set to expire on Saturday.</p> \n<p>In an increasingly fraught political government, it means the government will guarantee enough votes to approve the state of emergency decree. It comes after the government lost the support of opposition conservatives, the People’s party (PP), for any further extensions.</p> \n<h2>Covid-19 immunity only covers up to 5% of Czech Republic population, says study</h2> \n<p>Immunity to Covid-19 is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/06/coronavirus-update-cases-uk-live-news-us-task-force-trump-covid-19-usa-world-europe-deaths-brazil-brasil-israel?page=with:block-5eb25fe58f08d1ec4bbc6057#block-5eb25fe58f08d1ec4bbc6057\">building only very slowly in the Czech Republic</a> and probably does not cover more than 4-5% of the population, the country’s health ministry has said. The preliminary figures came from a mass testing for antibodies that started in April, the ministry added. The country, which has a population of 10.7 million, was one of the swiftest in Europe to impose curbs on travel and border crossings and shut most shops and restaurants in March.</p>"

Abe said a postponement was unavoidable if the 2020 Games could not be held in a complete manner amid the coronavirus pandemic. WHO: US has potential to be “epicentre of outbreak” A spokeswoman from the World Health Organization has said the US risks becoming the next centre of the coronavirus outbreak as the country is seeing a “very large acceleration” in cases. This comes amid concern the US president could be prioritising the economy in his crisis response. Trump said he was eager to reopen the US economy in weeks, not months, even as the death toll from the virus continued to rise. Spain death toll jumps overnight The number of new coronavirus cases in Spain jumped on Tuesday to 39,673 from 33,089 cases registered on Monday, the health ministry reported. Australia brings in tighter restrictions Large sections of the Australian economy and social life will be shut down, after the national cabinet agreed to a range of further restrictions on indoor and outdoor gatherings in addition to a ban on non-essential overseas travel to combat the Covid-19 outbreak. But despite the range of further restrictions, Scott Morrison said the national cabinet would not “just rush on the sense of an opinion of inevitability” towards a full lockdown, because measures to contain the spread of the virus may yet prevent it and more severe action would threaten the livelihoods of many Australians. Experts in Australia warn the country could have 50,000 new cases by Easter. Germany announces significant support package for economy Angela Merkel’s cabinet on Monday presented a support package worth hundreds of billions of euros to cushion the impact of the coronavirus crisis. Indonesia reports biggest daily increase in cases Indonesia on Tuesday confirmed 107 new coronavirus cases, the biggest daily increase to date in the South-east Asian country, bringing the total number of cases to 686. UK government gives more detail on UK lockdown The government had to clarify the rules around the UK lockdown amid confusion over who is allowed to travel to work, whether children can visit separated parents and what counts as exercise. Under the rules, people must stay at home unless they have to leave the house to work, to get essential supplies of food or medicine, to help the vulnerable or for one period of exercise a day. The biggest confusion was over whether workers should count their jobs as essential, with construction workers, taxi drivers and tradespeople unsure. Construction workers were told to still go to work but stay two metres apart and tradespeople, such as plumbers and electricians, could attend emergencies in people’s homes. South Africa cases rise to 554 as nation prepares for 21-day lockdown South Africa’s confirmed number of coronavirus cases rose to 554 from 402 a day earlier, as businesses raced to make plans for a nationwide lockdown from midnight on Thursday. Iran reports 122 deaths in last 24 hours Iran reported 1,726 new coronavirus cases in last 24 hours raising the total number to 24,811. China to lift travel restrictions in Hubei province All travel restrictions in and out of Hubei province, the centre of the pandemic, will be lifted on Wednesday, except for in the city Wuhan, which will have to wait until 8 April.

Though the sight of mass graves being dug and economies floundering has caused some to double-down on their pet grievances, to set fire to phone masts and indulge their fantasies about the Illuminati, it may yet cause more to think about getting back in touch with reality.",

                                        "html": "<p>There have not been too many encouraging graph lines in recent weeks. One that does offer a breath of optimism, however, is the slight downward curve that implies one of the most toxic trends of our times – the anti-vaxx movement – might just be in retreat. The shift is incremental, but in a UK-wide survey in mid-March, 7% of people insisted they would refuse to have a coronavirus vaccine if one were available. By early April, with hospital wards and mortuaries filling up, that number had dropped to 5%. Perhaps vaccine conspiracy cannot bear too much pandemic reality.</p> \n<p>As with the strategies against the virus itself, however, the response to any likely “cure” seems likely to vary from country to country. A similar survey in France, also conducted by the London-based <a href=\"https://www.vaccineconfidence.org/\">Vaccine Confidence Project</a>, suggested 18% of people would refuse a vaccine, while in a poll in New York, the city worst affected by the pandemic, 29% insisted they would not consent, a number that may render any programme ineffective.</p> \n<p>The depth of misplaced fear about vaccination – which remains one of the unambiguous triumphs of global public health – has been further illustrated in widely shared remarks from lockdown. Novak Djokovic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/19/novak-djokovic-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccination-tennis\">last week volunteered</a> that he would have to think seriously about whether he could even carry on playing tennis if a vaccine were to become mandatory to travel. The rapper MIA went further in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/22/mia-claims-british-vogue-pulled-article-about-her-over-anti-vax-comments\">informing her 650,000 Twitter followers</a> melodramatically, that “if I have to choose the vaccine or a [location-tracking] chip, I’m gonna choose death”.</p> \n<p>The most prominent American anti-vaxxer, Robert Kennedy Jr, meanwhile, amplified an unhinged conspiracy that believes Bill Gates is using the virus as part of a supposed plot to control the world’s population through immunisation.</p> \n<p>All pandemics trail a ready market in superstition, quackery and prejudice – a sense of powerlessness generates in some the need for catch-all theories, however deranged. At the time of the great plague in London, the spread of miracle cures and scapegoating prophecy was almost harder to contain than the infection itself. As part of its strategy the government was moved, <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/376/376-h/376-h.htm\">Daniel Defoe reported</a> in his <em>A Journal of the Plague Year</em>, to “suppress the printing of such Books and Pamphlets as terrify the People”. The efforts to prevent the spread of damaging conspiracies across our own media have shared a similar profile – and often a similar success rate – to the efforts to curb the disease.</p> \n<p>In this respect, the pandemic is something of a test case for the social media monopolies of Silicon Valley to deliver on their widely trumpeted commitment to slow the spread of dangerously false information. After being confronted with the evidence of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/10/facebook-fake-news-election-conspiracy-theories\">manipulation in the elections of 2016</a>, and the spread of such vile conspiracies as that which argued that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/31/alex-jones-pay-sandy-hook-conspiracy-theory\">Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax</a>, Facebook and Google and the rest have been forced to step up efforts to monitor and block extreme misinformation campaigns on their various platforms. Arguably, that effort is finally starting to show some effect.</p> \n<p>Counterintuitively, some evidence for that might be found in the response to the most pernicious of the current conspiracies which has, entirely without scientific foundation, sought to link the spread of coronavirus with the rollout of the 5G data network. The real-world effects have been the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/04/uk-phone-masts-attacked-amid-5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory\">acts of vandalism and arson</a> against mobile phone masts in the past weeks. Up to 50 such attacks have been reported, mostly on Merseyside and in the West Midlands, including the burning of the 5G mast adjacent to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/14/arsonists-attack-phone-mast-serving-nhs-nightingale-hospital\">new Nightingale hospital</a> outside Birmingham.</p>"

It should go without saying that there is no possible connection between the 5G radio waves and the spread of a virus. Even so, the government was forced to address the fears, calling them “dangerous nonsense”.</p> \n<p> Thinking about contagious ideas now, I recall <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/mar/12/scienceandnature.features1\">interviewing Daniel Dennett</a>, the philosopher of evolution, back in 2006, just before the launch of Twitter. Dennett was talking excitedly of a word that he and Richard Dawkins had coined to describe how Darwinist idea-germs could be sent into battle against the politicised viruses of creationism. He called these idea-germs “memes”. Nah, I thought at the time; it will never catch on.</p> \n<p>In the 14 years since, it has become second nature to trace the originators of particularly incendiary memes. <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory\">A story in </a><em><a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory\">Wired </a></em><a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory\">magazine</a> located the origin of the 5G conspiracy in an interview of 22 January in a Belgian newspaper with Kris Van Kerckhoven, a general practitioner from Putte, near Antwerp. He was quoted as saying that “5G is life-threatening”, but then added a speculative comment (“I have not done a fact-check”) that linked that falsehood to the virus then confined to China. The “link” became an ill-advised clickbait headline. (The piece, in <em>Het Laatste Nieuws</em>, was subsequently withdrawn.)</p> \n<p>If these words marked the moment when the 5G conspiracy established its RNA, however, the “wet market” for those ideas to jump species and spread human to human was a conference given on 11 March at the Health and Human Rights Summit, in Tucson, Arizona. The headline act was the original anti-vaxxer Andrew Wakefield, the discredited English doctor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/may/24/mmr-doctor-andrew-wakefield-struck-off\">who was struck off</a> by the GMC after being shown to have deliberately falsified evidence to make bogus claims of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Wakefield was in this case upstaged by a Californian, Thomas Cowan, author of <em>Cancer and the New Biology of Water</em>, who is serving a five-year suspension from medical practice for prescribing unlicensed drugs to cancer patients. Cowan claimed, entirely falsely, that Covid-19 was caused by electromagnetic waves and, also incorrectly, that Wuhan, where it originated, had been the guinea-pig city for 5G.</p>"

There has been no more virulent “conspiracy entrepreneur” than Alex Jones and his web channel, InfoWars. Jones has predictably loud-hailered the 5G and anti-vaxx lines: “This is the plan, folks,” he grunted at his viewers. “They plan – if they’ve fluoridated you and vaccinated you and stunned you and mesmerized you with the TV and put you in a trance – on killing you.” Meanwhile, “they” were determined “to make sure you don’t learn about the known antivirals”. Prominent among these, apparently, were Jones’s own “wellness” products: SuperSilver Whitening Toothpaste and ABL Nano Silver Gargle which, he claimed, “kills the sars-corona family at point-blank range”. (The only scientifically proven effect of the active ingredient in these products, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/does-colloidal-silver-work/\">colloidal silver</a>, is that it turns your skin blue.)</p> \n<p>Up until last year Jones’s vicious untruths would have been spread by millions of followers on YouTube and Facebook and Twitter. However, with trials pending involving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/31/sandy-hook-shooting-suicide-parents-fake-news-conspiracy\">the bereaved Sandy Hook parents</a> he repeatedly called “actors”, his platforms were finally shut down for “hate speech”.</p>"

When celebrity “super-spreaders” of the 5G claims have emerged in recent weeks – including the actor Woody Harrelson, the boxer Amir Khan and the breakfast show host <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/13/eamonn-holmes-says-5g-coronavirus-claims-may-not-be-false\">Eamonn Holmes</a> – they have the experienced the chill of immediate social media isolation and distancing.</p> \n<p>It is still early days in this ongoing battle between fact and fantasy, but perhaps the general global compliance with lockdown measures, and the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/07/technology/coronavirus-internet-use.html\">increasing appetite</a> for verifiable facts and figures, indicates that rational voices might yet be in the ascendancy.</p> \n<p>Even those on the frontline of protest against distancing measures in the southern American states have looked conspicuously conflicted. Several have marched under “coronahoax” banners while wearing face masks, hedging bets. Perhaps they have listened to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/trump-coronavirus-treatment-disinfectant\">snake-oil “hunches</a>” and tantrums of their president while the bodies pile up, and wondered. Perhaps they fear, privately, the tragic irony in <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/23/842551422/sadly-he-is-not-with-us-family-mourns-a-dad-who-denied-then-died-from-covid-19?t=1587724944068\">the story of </a><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/23/842551422/sadly-he-is-not-with-us-family-mourns-a-dad-who-denied-then-died-from-covid-19?t=1587724944068\">John McDaniel</a>, 60, of Ohio, who spent March posting conspiracy – “Does Anybody Have The Guts to Say This Covid-19 is a Political Ploy? Asking For A Friend. Prove Me Wrong” – before, last week, becoming the first person in his county to die from the disease.</p> \n<p>History shows that pandemics change things in surprising ways. Much has been made of the superstition that has attended other epidemics, but they have also generated great advances in public health, including vaccination; even the wildest conspiracy entrepreneur probably knows deep down that the only way out of the current tragedy is careful application of the scientific method.</p> \n<p>In the past few weeks we have been exposed to a reality that all human generations before ours – and many millions in our own times in less advantaged parts of the planet – have known as a fact of life: that we exist in a precarious world of rapidly transmitted infectious diseases without an obvious cure. Though the sight of mass graves being dug and economies floundering has caused some to double-down on their pet grievances, to set fire to phone masts and indulge their fantasies about the Illuminati, it may yet cause more to think about getting back in touch with reality.</p>"

Most restaurants, even apparently successful ones, run on a tight financial model, riding seasonal waves of trade, often with great peaks and troughs. The first three months of the year just gone are famously a major trough. Viable restaurants could easily be made unviable by the lockdown itself. “People think there’s some pot of gold sitting in the bank,” says chef Angela Hartnett, who has the Michelin-starred Murano and three Murano Cafes scattered around central London. “But there really isn’t. Restaurants are run on very tight margins.”</p> <p>Chef Richard Corrigan, who has three restaurants including Bentley’s off Piccadilly and the recently opened Daffodil Mulligan in Shoreditch, agrees. “If this was a three-month closure, we’d get through. The real issue we’re facing is a six-month closure which, in the absence of any cash flow, will exhaust us.” Under the government’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/05/sunak-emergency-loan-cbils-flaws-isnt-superman-after-all\">Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme</a>, the banks have agreed to provide £250,000 without personal guarantees. But that, says Corrigan, wouldn’t even touch the sides. “In the centre of London, you’d need £600,000, which is an awful lot of debt. That in itself will make many businesses unviable.”</p> <p>Similar calculations are being made elsewhere in the UK. Gary Usher of Elite Bistros, who has six much-loved restaurants across north-west England, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jul/16/how-to-crowdfund-a-restaurant-empire\">Sticky Walnut in Chester</a> and Kala in Manchester, says he is trying to “remain positive” but it’s tough. For the moment his staff are dealt with. “If we hadn’t had the 80% salary replacer, Elite Bistros would have closed.” The acute stage is over. Now the situation is chronic. “We have no money coming in and we still have bills.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7834899e86a5940a4f14569bfaec6417e676e1a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7834899e86a5940a4f14569bfaec6417e676e1a8/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Padella in London’s Borough Market, before lockdown: ‘If we want restaurants to return to trading, we need to give them our business as soon as we feel able to do so.’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Padella in London’s Borough Market, before lockdown: ‘If we want restaurants to return to trading, we need to give them our business as soon as we feel able to do so.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Benjamin John/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is also the issue of rent which, on average, should be about 10% of a restaurant’s turnover. Restaurateurs report that some landlords have been extremely accommodating, by offering to write off up to three months’ rent. Others have been far less flexible. In late March the<em> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24643dcc-5860-4401-8d92-511ed7952e58\">Financial Times </a></em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24643dcc-5860-4401-8d92-511ed7952e58\">reported</a> that Criterion Capital, which owns large slabs of property around London’s Leicester Square, had threatened the 37-strong Caffe Concerto group, which occupies one of its sites on Haymarket, with a winding up order, because it had not paid rent on one site. Caffe Concerto director <a href=\"https://www.thecaterer.com/news/aggressive-landlords-back-off-suck-it-up-industry-says\">Stephano Borjak</a><a href=\"https://www.thecaterer.com/news/aggressive-landlords-back-off-suck-it-up-industry-says\"> told the</a><em><a href=\"https://www.thecaterer.com/news/aggressive-landlords-back-off-suck-it-up-industry-says\"> Caterer</a></em>: “We are using our cashflow for wages.

(Any ingredients left over at the shutdown were used in meals provided for free to the homeless in Chester.) And then there’s the question of whether they will still have the staff with which to do so. Angela Hartnett shut down her restaurants even before the government had officially told her she had to. “Partly we did that to enable our staff, 80% of whom come from the likes of Italy, Spain and France, to get home to their families. I’d like to think they’ll still want to work for us at the end but I just don’t know.”</p> <p>But the bluntest of issues is: will there be any customers? As Beckett says, “There will probably still be a demand for social distancing at first.” And even if there isn’t, people’s behaviour may well have changed. “With all this time at home people will have learned to cook more and take pleasure in it,” says Usher. “I simply wonder what people’s relationship with restaurants will be.”</p> <p>One gastropub operator told me: “People think we’re in the food and drink business but we’re not. We’re in the atmosphere business. The food is terribly important but it’s not what brings people in. It’s about the social side.” And who will want to socialise after this? The optimistic view is that, after a lengthy lockdown, everyone. “There may be lots of people who want to go out,” says Hart. “But then again, lots of people have lost their jobs and will be absolutely skint.”</p> <p>All the chefs and restaurateurs I spoke to described some form of staggered reopening to match the likely slow return of customers. “I could see us opening for a few services but not for all of them,” says Hart, “and expanding out from there.” Or as Usher says, “We might reopen one of our restaurants a week.” What will matter, Hartnett says, “is if restaurants looked after their regulars well.

                                        "html": "<p>“Many have survived the closure,” says Sam Hart, who co-owns 11 restaurants in London including Quo Vadis and the four-strong Barrafina group. “The question is how do you survive the reopening?” Or, as Will Beckett of the nationwide Hawksmoor steakhouse group puts it: “Everyone is nervous about what happens when ministers go on television and say, tally-ho, let’s get on with life.” As Beckett says, the scheme to pay 80% of staff wages up to £2,500 a month will seemingly be turned off. Costs will return. The big question is, will the customers?</p> \n<p>A significant issue is the government’s initiative to underwrite loans from the banks to businesses, with the proviso that those businesses be viable. Most restaurants, even apparently successful ones, run on a tight financial model, riding seasonal waves of trade, often with great peaks and troughs. The first three months of the year just gone are famously a major trough. Viable restaurants could easily be made unviable by the lockdown itself. “People think there’s some pot of gold sitting in the bank,” says chef Angela Hartnett, who has the Michelin-starred Murano and three Murano Cafes scattered around central London. “But there really isn’t. Restaurants are run on very tight margins.”</p> \n<p>Chef Richard Corrigan, who has three restaurants including Bentley’s off Piccadilly and the recently opened Daffodil Mulligan in Shoreditch, agrees. “If this was a three-month closure, we’d get through. The real issue we’re facing is a six-month closure which, in the absence of any cash flow, will exhaust us.” Under the government’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/05/sunak-emergency-loan-cbils-flaws-isnt-superman-after-all\">Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme</a>, the banks have agreed to provide £250,000 without personal guarantees. But that, says Corrigan, wouldn’t even touch the sides. “In the centre of London, you’d need £600,000, which is an awful lot of debt. That in itself will make many businesses unviable.”</p> \n<p>Similar calculations are being made elsewhere in the UK. Gary Usher of Elite Bistros, who has six much-loved restaurants across north-west England, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jul/16/how-to-crowdfund-a-restaurant-empire\">Sticky Walnut in Chester</a> and Kala in Manchester, says he is trying to “remain positive” but it’s tough. For the moment his staff are dealt with. “If we hadn’t had the 80% salary replacer, Elite Bistros would have closed.” The acute stage is over. Now the situation is chronic. “We have no money coming in and we still have bills.”</p>"

Restaurateurs report that some landlords have been extremely accommodating, by offering to write off up to three months’ rent. Others have been far less flexible. In late March the<em> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24643dcc-5860-4401-8d92-511ed7952e58\">Financial Times </a></em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24643dcc-5860-4401-8d92-511ed7952e58\">reported</a> that Criterion Capital, which owns large slabs of property around London’s Leicester Square, had threatened the 37-strong Caffe Concerto group, which occupies one of its sites on Haymarket, with a winding up order, because it had not paid rent on one site. Caffe Concerto director <a href=\"https://www.thecaterer.com/news/aggressive-landlords-back-off-suck-it-up-industry-says\">Stephano Borjak</a><a href=\"https://www.thecaterer.com/news/aggressive-landlords-back-off-suck-it-up-industry-says\"> told the</a><em><a href=\"https://www.thecaterer.com/news/aggressive-landlords-back-off-suck-it-up-industry-says\"> Caterer</a></em>: “We are using our cashflow for wages. We urge our landlords to bear with us at least until we open for trade.” Criterion’s <a href=\"Landlords%20and%20tenants%20feel%20the%20pain%20as%20coronavirus%20hits%20rents\">Andrew Sell told the FT</a>: “We are driven to take such action because we are a business that has an obligation to our lenders, to collect rent and meet their demands for interest payment to be made on time … The property industry is being treated as the nation’s bank.” Kate Nicholls, chief executive of industry body UK Hospitality, says she has heard repeated stories of restaurant owners facing issues of this sort: “Too many landlords, banks and insurance companies are simply not sharing the pain of this.”</p>   \n<p>All of this feeds into anxieties around the prospect of reopening. “We will need between £15,000 and £20,000 just to restock our restaurants with ingredients,” say Usher. (Any ingredients left over at the shutdown were used in meals provided for free to the homeless in Chester.) And then there’s the question of whether they will still have the staff with which to do so. Angela Hartnett shut down her restaurants even before the government had officially told her she had to. “Partly we did that to enable our staff, 80% of whom come from the likes of Italy, Spain and France, to get home to their families. I’d like to think they’ll still want to work for us at the end but I just don’t know.”</p> \n<p>But the bluntest of issues is: will there be any customers? As Beckett says, “There will probably still be a demand for social distancing at first.” And even if there isn’t, people’s behaviour may well have changed. “With all this time at home people will have learned to cook more and take pleasure in it,” says Usher. “I simply wonder what people’s relationship with restaurants will be.”</p> \n<p>One gastropub operator told me: “People think we’re in the food and drink business but we’re not. We’re in the atmosphere business. The food is terribly important but it’s not what brings people in. It’s about the social side.” And who will want to socialise after this? The optimistic view is that, after a lengthy lockdown, everyone. “There may be lots of people who want to go out,” says Hart. “But then again, lots of people have lost their jobs and will be absolutely skint.”</p> \n<p>All the chefs and restaurateurs I spoke to described some form of staggered reopening to match the likely slow return of customers. “I could see us opening for a few services but not for all of them,” says Hart, “and expanding out from there.” Or as Usher says, “We might reopen one of our restaurants a week.” What will matter, Hartnett says, “is if restaurants looked after their regulars well. Then they are more likely to return.”</p>"

The restaurant business must get enough warning that the lockdown is coming to an end, says UK Hospitality’s Nicholls. “The government mustn’t turn the taps off on the business support quickly. It has to be tapered or we’ll be looking at mass unemployment across the sector.”</p> \n<p>Is there any lighter news? Perhaps a little. Usually, if there’s strife in the restaurant industry, it’s the small independents who suffer first. But there’s good reason to think the smaller operations will find reopening more straightforward than the big groups. “Because we’re small, we’re adaptable,” says Max Gott of game-based restaurant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jan/12/bistro-46-newcastle-a-small-restaurant-with-heart-game\">Bistro 46 in Newcastle</a>, which has just three full-time members of staff. “If we need to do some takeaway to get us through then we will. We shoot a lot of our own game so that’s still there, and we deal with small suppliers who have moved to a delivery model for the duration.”</p> \n<p>However, like everyone else, he wonders “whether people will still want to eat out”. Which brings us to the one thing we, the diners, can do. If we want restaurants to return to trading, if we want them all to reopen their boarded-up eyes, we need to give them our business as soon as we feel able to do so. It’s as simple as that.</p>"
