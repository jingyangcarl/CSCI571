                            "bodyTextSummary": "Three pastors in California are suing state officials who have placed restrictions on people gathering at church services due to the coronavirus outbreak. The lawsuit lodged in the US district court for the central district of California, alleges Californians have been denied their “fundamental rights” of freedom of religion, speech and assembly due to the restrictions, which are aimed at slowing the spread of Covid-19. Dhillon Law Group, headed by California Republican party official Harmeet Dhillon, is behind the lawsuit, along with three pastors and a churchgoer. California governor Gavin Newsom, one of the targets of the lawsuit, issued a stay at home order on 19 March and closed non-essential businesses. Despite this directive, some worshippers have continued to gather, including in Sacramento county where 71 people linked to a single church became infected with the coronavirus. California isn’t the only state where there has been a backlash against shuttering churches in order to protect public health. In Kentucky, Governor Andy Beshear said state officials would be recording the license plates of anyone gathering at Easter services or other gatherings and imposing a two-week quarantine. Rand Paul, a Republican senator from the state, said the governor needed to “take a step back”. In Kansas, Governor Laura Kelly has been locked in a battle with Republican state lawmakers over limiting the size of church congregations.

Honest.\nIn short, Axios this morning puts Joe Biden in the lead against Donald Trump six key states, firstly Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, three of the rust belt, usually blue states which Trump famously won from under Hillary Clinton’s nose in 2016. But it also has Biden up in Florida, Arizona and North Carolina, sunnier places, usually Republican, which if picked up would allow the former vice-president some leeway in those first three, where Trump remains strong. And here’s a new poll from Arizona: Biden 52%, Trump 43%. There are of course caveats to every poll and OH Insights lists them here. Either which way, Bernie Sanders’ endorsement of Biden yesterday has seemingly wrapped up the Democratic primary – some sort of House of Cards-esque Andrew Cuomo late move notwithstanding – and for now the question is will the 3 November election go ahead in its usual form or will the bizarre scenes in Wisconsin last week presage some move to making voting easier and safer?

The IMF said the sudden shock caused by the spread of the coronavirus meant it had been forced to tear up an estimate it made just three months ago of 3.3% global growth this year and replace it with an expected contraction of 3%. Until now, the downturn that followed the near-meltdown of the global financial system in late 2008 has been the most serious of the postwar ear, with global activity shrinking by 0.1% in 2009.

                            "bodyTextSummary": "Britain’s economy could shrink by 35% and unemployment rise by more than 2 million people due to the coronavirus crisis, an official economics forecaster warns, writes Richard Partington, the Guardian’s economics correspondent. In a stark assessment of the economic fallout from Covid-19 as lockdown measures bring the country to a standstill, the Office for Budget Responsibility said that gross domestic product (GDP) could plunge by more than a third in the second quarter of the year and 13% for 2020 as a whole. Sounding the alarm that the immediate hit to living standards could be worse than the initial shock of the 2008 financial crisis, it said joblessness could hit 10% by the end of June and government borrowing this year would increase at the fastest pace since the second world war. Here is an extract from the OBR’s report: We do not attempt to predict how long the economic lockdown will last – that is a matter for the government, informed by medical advice. But, to illustrate some of the potential fiscal effects, we assume a three-month lockdown due to public health restrictions followed by another three-month period when they are partially lifted. For now, we assume no lasting economic hit. Real GDP falls 35% in the second quarter, but bounces back quickly. Unemployment rises by more than 2 million to 10% in the second quarter, but then declines more slowly than GDP recovers. Policy measures support households and companies’ finances through the shock. Public sector net borrowing increases by £218bn in 2020-21 relative to our March budget forecast (to reach £273bn or 14% of GDP), before falling back close to forecast in the medium term.

So far, 119,687 people have died in the pandemic. </li> \n <li> <strong><strong>France restrictions to ease in May. </strong></strong>In a televised address, the French president said France would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/macron-france-remain-strict-lockdown-for-another-month\">start returning to normal life on 11 May</a>, if citizens were “civic, responsible and respected the rules” – and if the number of cases of coronavirus continued to drop. He said that only by respecting the confinement rules would the battle against Covid-19 be won. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-live-news-cases-worldwide-near-2-million-trump-repeats-who-funding-threat-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9565cc8f081a236f192e65#block-5e9565cc8f081a236f192e65\">The country’s budget minister said </a>its budget deficit was set to hit a post-war record of 9% of economic output this year. </li> \n <li> <strong><strong>Brace for ‘extraordinary’ crisis, says Vladimir Putin. </strong></strong>As Moscow tightened its lockdown measures, Russia reported its highest daily infection figures yet. In a video conference with officials on Monday, the country’s president said the next weeks would be “decisive” for Russia’s fight against the virus as the situation “is changing practically every day, and unfortunately not for the better.” </li> \n <li> <strong><strong>China cases emerge on Russia border. </strong></strong>China reported 89 new coronavirus cases on 13 April, down from 108 the previous day. China’s state broadcaster had reported earlier that 79 of the day’s imported cases were in the northeast province of Heilongjiang, which shares a border with Russia. Hubei province reported 0 new deaths and cases. </li> \n <li> <strong><strong>Trump threatens to withdraw funding from WHO again. </strong></strong>In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/trump-us-coronavirus-briefing-latest-media\">bizarre and antagonistic press briefing</a> that included the airing of a campaign-style video attacking the press and Trump announcing his authority over lockdown rules is “total”, the US president said he will also decide this week whether he plans to reopen the US by 1 May. Payments to individuals as part of the US economic stimulus package will be made by Wednesday, US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said. </li> \n <li> <strong><strong>Hospitalisations in New York start to plateau. </strong></strong>A glimmer of hope. Deaths and hospitalisations are falling in New York. “Yes, I think you can say the worst is over,” said the state’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, announcing an alliance with six other governors in the region to explore how to lift restrictions. “If you do it wrong, it can backfire, and we’ve seen that with other places in the globe,” Cuomo said. </li> \n <li><strong>England’s death toll at record levels. </strong>Coronavirus has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-pushes-england-death-rate-to-highest-level-ever\">pushed the death toll in England</a> to its highest level since official weekly statistics began in 2005, with fatalities running at almost 40% above the average. The Office for National Statistics said that in the week to 3 April, 16,387 people died in England and Wales, an increase of 5,246 deaths compared with the previous week and 6,082 more than the five-year average.</li> \n <li> <strong><strong>IMF to provide immediate debt relief to 25 countries. </strong></strong>The debt relief will be made available under the IMF’s Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust.

Gantz repeatedly vowed not to sit in government with Netanyahu because of the criminal corruption charges against the prime minister.</p> \n<p>But with the virus crisis worsening, and his own shaky alliance fraying, Gantz made an about-face late last month and accepted an offer from Netanyahu to pursue a joint government to deal with the pandemic. </p> \n<p>Israel has reported over 11,800 cases and at least 117 deaths from the outbreak, which has paralysed the economy, shuttered Israelis in their homes and driven unemployment to record highs.</p>"

                            "bodyTextSummary": "In New Zealand, new modelling from the Treasury has painted a dire picture of the country’s economic prospects for the next year, with a surge in unemployment to as much as 13% even if Covid-19 infections are contained and lockdown rules eased after the initial four weeks. A jobless rate of up to 26% – and a fall in GDP of 23% – is predicted if the country is forced to remain in its strictest level of shutdown for a total of six months before moving to marginally lighter measures. However, with a larger fiscal stimulus package than the NZ$20bn (£9.7bn) already pledged by the government, the 13% jobless rate modelled could hit a much lower peak of 8.5% before falling to 5.5% in the year to June 2021. On Tuesday, Robertson pledged to release further support. All seven of the scenarios modelled – the first released since the pandemic reached New Zealand – predicted that unemployment would be higher in the June quarter of this year than the 6.7% reached during the 2008 global financial crisis.
