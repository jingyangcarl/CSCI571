                            "bodyHtml": "<p>Welcome to our weekly roundup of developments in the coronavirus pandemic that continues to spread around the world. As the outbreak <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-100-days-that-changed-the-world\">passed the 100-day mark</a> and many countries extended their lockdowns, others moved to relax restrictions wary that cases may take off again.</p> <h2><strong>Scientists shed light on </strong><strong>immune response to coronavirus</strong></h2> <p>On Monday, a team at Fudan University in Shanghai <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047365v1\">reported the first detailed analysis</a> of the immune response in patients with coronavirus. Tests on the blood of 175 patients who had been discharged from hospitals in Shanghai revealed that neutralising antibodies – those that can wipe out the virus – usually arose 10 to 15 days after the onset of illness and targeted three different parts of the “spike” protein on the virus’s surface.</p> <p>While older patients produced the highest levels of neutralising antibodies, many patients had low levels and 10 did not appear to generate them at all. If the findings hold up – the study has yet to be reviewed and published – they have widespread implications. The more robust immune response from older people suggests their blood plasma may work best in trials that are assessing whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-survivors-blood-plasma-could-be-used-to-fight-infection\">convalescent plasma</a> infusions can help seriously ill patients overcome the virus. But the findings may frustrate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/08/health-minister-defends-uk-coronavirus-testing-approach-chris-whitty-germany-covid-19\">efforts to manufacture an accurate antibody test</a> for the virus if many people have low or even non-existent levels of neutralising antibodies. This week it emerged that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/uk-government-urged-to-abandon-poor-finger-prick-antibody-tests-coronavirus\">none of the antibody tests</a> purchased by the UK government were good enough to roll out.</p> <p>The work also has implications for<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/immunity-passports-could-speed-up-return-to-work-after-covid-19\"> “immunity passports”</a>, which could allow people to return to normal life if blood tests showed they had developed immunity to the virus. Nearly 6% of the recovered patients had no neutralising antibodies, suggesting that other parts of the immune system had cleared the infection, without producing long-term immunity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ba9786c6-c779-4063-8bf9-1d3009eb7c70\"         data-atom-type=\"media\"    > </gu-atom> </figure>   <h2><strong>Not everyone agrees on wearing face masks</strong></h2> <p>Whether or not to don a face mask in public became a matter of debate and confusion. After a <a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak\">review of new evidence</a>, the World Health Organization maintained its view on Monday that while people who have cough, fever and difficulty breathing should wear a mask and seek medical help, there was no need for healthy people to wear face masks in public. The organisation conceded that people without symptoms can spread the virus, but only recommended healthy people wear face masks when they were caring for a coronavirus patient and in the same room. The masks can help prevent infections by catching large virus-laden droplets that are expelled from patients when they cough and sneeze, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/face-masks-coronavirus-scientists-evidence-covid-19-public\">David Heymann</a>, who chairs the WHO’s risk committee, said face masks can give people a false sense of security if they do not combine an effective one with eye protection and adopt strict hand hygiene measures.</p> <p>The UK has a similar stance to the WHO and does not recommend healthy people wear masks in public. But the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) not only <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html\">advises people to wear face masks</a> outside, but offers guidance on how to make “cloth face coverings” too. On Tuesday, US government scientists argued the case for face coverings after <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20051177v1\">preliminary research</a> showed people spray out thousands of tiny saliva droplets when they speak simple sentences such as “stay healthy”. Adriaan Bax at the US National Institutes of Health, who led the work, found a damp homemade cloth face mask “dramatically reduced droplet excretion”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a81dbd86-f7c7-4b2d-affa-9a6aff9b9b5f\"         data-atom-type=\"media\"    > </gu-atom> </figure>   <h2><strong>Some countries look towards easing </strong><strong>lockdowns</strong></h2> <p>Following in the footsteps of China, a number of countries announced plans to relax restrictions they had put in place to stop the spread of the virus. On Wednesday, China, lifted its 11-week lockdown in Wuhan where the outbreak began. The following day, the Czech Republic allowed bicycle shops and DIY, hobby and hardware stores to reopen. After the Easter break, Austria will let small shops, DIY stores and garden centres return to business, while Denmark plans to reopen kindergartens and primary schools. But with the virus still present and large numbers of people still vulnerable to infection, health officials are watching closely for cases to surge again. As Denmark’s prime minister, Metter Frederiksen, commented: “It’s like walking a tightrope.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/apr/08/wuhan-ends-coronavirus-lockdown-in-pictures\">Wuhan ends coronavirus lockdown – in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, was admitted to intensive care for several days but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/09/boris-johnson-moved-from-intensive-care-but-stays-in-hospital\">returned to a ward on Thursday</a> after he improved without needing mechanical ventilation. In his absence, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, scotched hopes for an early end to the UK lockdown and refused to be drawn on exit strategies until the country was beyond the peak of the epidemic.

President Trump imposed restrictions on travellers from China at the end of January but only blocked travel from most European countries in mid-March. Separate teams at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City and New York University reached similar conclusions after studying the genetic code of viruses obtained from patients in the region.

                            "bodyTextSummary": "Welcome to our weekly roundup of developments in the coronavirus pandemic that continues to spread around the world. As the outbreak passed the 100-day mark and many countries extended their lockdowns, others moved to relax restrictions wary that cases may take off again. Scientists shed light on immune response to coronavirus On Monday, a team at Fudan University in Shanghai reported the first detailed analysis of the immune response in patients with coronavirus. Tests on the blood of 175 patients who had been discharged from hospitals in Shanghai revealed that neutralising antibodies – those that can wipe out the virus – usually arose 10 to 15 days after the onset of illness and targeted three different parts of the “spike” protein on the virus’s surface. While older patients produced the highest levels of neutralising antibodies, many patients had low levels and 10 did not appear to generate them at all. If the findings hold up – the study has yet to be reviewed and published – they have widespread implications. The more robust immune response from older people suggests their blood plasma may work best in trials that are assessing whether convalescent plasma infusions can help seriously ill patients overcome the virus. But the findings may frustrate efforts to manufacture an accurate antibody test for the virus if many people have low or even non-existent levels of neutralising antibodies. This week it emerged that none of the antibody tests purchased by the UK government were good enough to roll out. The work also has implications for “immunity passports”, which could allow people to return to normal life if blood tests showed they had developed immunity to the virus. Nearly 6% of the recovered patients had no neutralising antibodies, suggesting that other parts of the immune system had cleared the infection, without producing long-term immunity.\nNot everyone agrees on wearing face masks Whether or not to don a face mask in public became a matter of debate and confusion. After a review of new evidence, the World Health Organization maintained its view on Monday that while people who have cough, fever and difficulty breathing should wear a mask and seek medical help, there was no need for healthy people to wear face masks in public. The organisation conceded that people without symptoms can spread the virus, but only recommended healthy people wear face masks when they were caring for a coronavirus patient and in the same room. The masks can help prevent infections by catching large virus-laden droplets that are expelled from patients when they cough and sneeze, but David Heymann, who chairs the WHO’s risk committee, said face masks can give people a false sense of security if they do not combine an effective one with eye protection and adopt strict hand hygiene measures. The UK has a similar stance to the WHO and does not recommend healthy people wear masks in public. But the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) not only advises people to wear face masks outside, but offers guidance on how to make “cloth face coverings” too. On Tuesday, US government scientists argued the case for face coverings after preliminary research showed people spray out thousands of tiny saliva droplets when they speak simple sentences such as “stay healthy”. Adriaan Bax at the US National Institutes of Health, who led the work, found a damp homemade cloth face mask “dramatically reduced droplet excretion”.\nSome countries look towards easing lockdowns Following in the footsteps of China, a number of countries announced plans to relax restrictions they had put in place to stop the spread of the virus. On Wednesday, China, lifted its 11-week lockdown in Wuhan where the outbreak began. The following day, the Czech Republic allowed bicycle shops and DIY, hobby and hardware stores to reopen. After the Easter break, Austria will let small shops, DIY stores and garden centres return to business, while Denmark plans to reopen kindergartens and primary schools. But with the virus still present and large numbers of people still vulnerable to infection, health officials are watching closely for cases to surge again. As Denmark’s prime minister, Metter Frederiksen, commented: “It’s like walking a tightrope.”\nThe British prime minister, Boris Johnson, was admitted to intensive care for several days but returned to a ward on Thursday after he improved without needing mechanical ventilation. In his absence, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, scotched hopes for an early end to the UK lockdown and refused to be drawn on exit strategies until the country was beyond the peak of the epidemic. But discussions are underway in Whitehall where options range from a “youth first” policy that would allow young workers to return to their jobs, to a staggered sector-by-sector approach. To find out more about how to lift the lockdowns, listen to Adam Kucharski, associate professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and author of The Rules of Contagion on the latest episode of our Science Weekly podcast.\nNew York’s epidemic was fuelled by travel back from Europe Scientists have found that the coronavirus outbreak in New York was largely fuelled by US citizens bringing the infection back from Europe. President Trump imposed restrictions on travellers from China at the end of January but only blocked travel from most European countries in mid-March. Separate teams at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City and New York University reached similar conclusions after studying the genetic code of viruses obtained from patients in the region.

The country’s total number of cases now stands at 94,417 – up from 85,195 on Monday – and its death toll at 8,189.</p> \n<h2>Russia records biggest daily increase for seventh day running</h2> \n<p>The number of coronavirus cases in Russia jumped to 2,337 on Tuesday, an increase of 500, as the country recorded its biggest daily rise for the seventh day in a row. In Russia, 18 people who contracted the coronavirus have died, while 121 people have recovered.</p> \n<h2>Italy extends lockdown until Easter</h2> \n<p>Italy has extended its lockdown until Easter. The number of new coronavirus infections reported on Monday was 1,648, as opposed to 3,815 the previous day. The death toll, however, rose again, with 812 deaths reported, compared with 756 the day before.</p> \n<h2>Death toll in England and Wales higher than previously reported</h2> \n<p>An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/england-and-wales-coronavirus-death-toll-40-higher-than-previously-stated\">additional 40 previously unreported coronavirus deaths occurred in England and Wales</a> earlier this month, according to new official backdated figures. The figures, which are based on death certificates, show there were 210 deaths where Covid-19 was listed as a cause by 20 March, 40 more than the 170 announced by the NHS at that stage.</p> \n<p>The figure is higher because it includes deaths outside hospitals, including those in homes and care homes, and includes patients who had not tested positive for the virus but were suspected of having the disease.</p> \n<h2>Ireland: confirmed cases of coronavirus halve</h2> \n<p>Ireland’s daily growth rate in confirmed cases of coronavirus has halved. Ireland on Monday confirmed 295 new cases, the second highest daily number, bringing the total to 2,910. It recorded eight deaths, bringing the death toll to 54. Northern Ireland has 533 confirmed cases and 22 deaths.</p> \n<h2>WHO: epidemic ‘far from over’ in the Asia-Pacific region</h2> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/us-deaths-pass-3000-as-world-bank-warns-covid-19-will-drive-east-asia-into-poverty\">coronavirus epidemic is “far from over” in the Asia-Pacific region</a>, and current measures to curb the spread of the virus are buying time for countries to prepare for large-scale community transmissions, a WHO official said.</p> \n<h2>Coronavirus study reveals increased risks from middle age</h2> \n<p>The first comprehensive study of Covid-19 deaths and hospitalisations in mainland China has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/new-coronavirus-study-reveals-increased-risks-from-middle-age\">revealed in stark detail the increase in risk for coronavirus patients </a>once they reach middle age.</p> \n<h2>US coronavirus deaths pass 3,000</h2> \n<p>Figures from Johns Hopkins University show the toll from coronavirus in the US now exceeds that from the September 11 terrorist attacks. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US, at 164,539 is double those in China.</p> \n<h2>World Bank warns of ‘unprecedented global shock’</h2> \n<p>China’s growth could come to a standstill while 11 million more people in East Asia could be driven into poverty.</p>"

But, he said, it was not enough to limit testing to small numbers of people who fitted risk criteria that might be out of date – people over a certain age with a history of travel to China, for instance.</p> \n<p>Some countries had not established sufficient capacity for isolating people, he said. Other countries were too willing to give up on contact tracing too soon, which could help slow the spread. Some countries were not communicating well with their people, giving them the information they need to keep themselves and others safe.</p> \n<p>The WHO warning came as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/italy-faces-calls-to-close-everything-to-tackle-coronavirus\">the death toll from the virus in Italy rose by 31% in 24 hours</a> to 827, and the government there began considering imposing even tighter restrictions on daily life and announced billions of euros in financial relief to cushion against the economic shock.</p> \n<p>In Iran, by far the hardest-hit country in the Middle East, the senior vice-president and two other cabinet ministers were reported to have been diagnosed with Covid-19, the illness caused by the virus.

In an online briefing to journalists on Thursday, John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control, said maybe 15m tests would be required across the continent in the next three months, the Associated Press reported.

France unveils new €110bn coronavirus support package The French government has unveiled a vast package of measures estimated at €110bn (£95.8bn) to help the country through the coronavirus crisis. A new budget bill announced by the prime minister, Édouard Philippe, aims to address the economic and social problems caused by the pandemic. It is a significant increase on the €45bn announced in March, but the finance minister, Gérard Darmanin, said no one could be sure €110n would be enough. “The government is prepared to go further if necessary,” Darmanin said. France is among Europe’s worst-hit countries, with more than 134,000 confirmed cases and in excess of 17,000 deaths, according to figures compiled by John Hopkins University. Calls for condemnation of Hungarian government’s anti-democratic response to Covid-19 crisis MEPs and civil society groups have called on the European commission and European Council to condemn the Hungarian government’s exploitation of the coronavirus crisis to erode democracy. In an open letter, 80 signatories, including Human Rights Watch and Transparency International, warned the European commission president, Ursula Gertrud von der Leyen, and the European Council president, Charles Michel, that they must not allow Hungary’s nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orbán to use the pandemic as a smokescreen for anti-democratic activities The measures, in place since late March, have been criticised for the sweeping powers they hand to Orbán, to rule by decree. Another part of the bill provides penalties of up to five years in prison for those spreading misinformation during the pandemic. French military orders inquiry into coronavirus outbreak on board flagship aircraft carrier The French military has ordered an inquiry into how the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier, the flagship of the naval fleet, was contaminated with Covid-19 after a third of its crew tested positive for the virus. The cluster is especially puzzling as the nuclear-powered vessel had reportedly had no contact with the outside world since it went to sea on 15 March. Last Friday, the French defence ministry confirmed 50 sailors had coronavirus and the ship, in the Atlantic at the time, was ordered back to base in the port of Toulon on France’s Mediterranean coast. It arrived on Sunday, two weeks earlier than planned. Since then 668 sailors of the 1,767-strong crew have tested positive, the French defence ministry confirmed.",

It is a significant increase on the €45bn announced in March, but the finance minister, Gérard Darmanin, said no one could be sure €110n would be enough. “The government is prepared to go further if necessary,” Darmanin said.</p> \n<p>France is among Europe’s worst-hit countries, with more than 134,000 confirmed cases and in excess of 17,000 deaths, <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">according to figures compiled by John Hopkins University</a>.</p> \n<h2><strong>Calls for condemnation of Hungarian government’s anti-democratic response to Covid-19 crisis</strong></h2> \n<p>MEPs and civil society groups have called on the European commission and European Council to condemn the Hungarian government’s exploitation of the coronavirus crisis to erode democracy.</p> \n<p>In <a href=\"https://transparency.eu/ruleoflaw-open-letter/\">an open letter</a>, 80 signatories, including Human Rights Watch and Transparency International, warned the European commission president, Ursula Gertrud von der Leyen, and the European Council president, Charles Michel, that they must not allow Hungary’s nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orbán to use the pandemic as a smokescreen for anti-democratic activities</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/hungary-jail-for-coronavirus-misinformation-viktor-orban\">The measures, in place since </a>late March, have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/hungary-emergency-law-incompatible-with-being-in-eu-say-meps-group-viktor-orban\">criticised</a> for the sweeping powers they hand to Orbán, to rule by decree. Another part of the bill provides penalties of up to five years in prison for those spreading misinformation during the pandemic.</p> \n<h2><strong>French military orders inquiry into coronavirus outbreak on board flagship aircraft carrier</strong></h2> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-live-news-cases-worldwide-top-2-million-trump-doubts-china-death-toll?page=with:block-5e983c198f08ea7431f43e60#block-5e983c198f08ea7431f43e60\">French military has ordered an inquiry</a> into how the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier, the flagship of the naval fleet, was contaminated with Covid-19 after a third of its crew tested positive for the virus.</p> \n<p>The cluster is especially puzzling as the nuclear-powered vessel had reportedly had no contact with the outside world since it went to sea on 15 March.</p> \n<p>Last Friday, the French defence ministry confirmed 50 sailors had coronavirus and the ship, in the Atlantic at the time, was ordered back to base in the port of Toulon on France’s Mediterranean coast. It arrived on Sunday, two weeks earlier than planned. Since then 668 sailors of the 1,767-strong crew have tested positive, the French defence ministry confirmed.</p>"
